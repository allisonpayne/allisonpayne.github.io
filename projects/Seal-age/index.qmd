I led a class of 14 undergraduate students in designing and executing this project investigating the types of changes in elephant seal demography and behavior as they age. We found that pupping probability and offspring first-year survival both decrease with maternal age after a threshold. Offspring recruitment, offspring sex ratio, and annual cycle timing were not impacted by maternal age.
