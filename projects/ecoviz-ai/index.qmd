I had the opportunity to work as a science facilitator for the [EcoViz + AI Workshop](https://ecoviz-ai.github.io/), led by Dr. Jessica Kendall-Bar and supported by Schmidt Sciences and UC San Diego.

Together with technical facilitator Dr. Max Czapanskiy, I helped lead 30 postdocs, faculty, and technical specialists to create science communication videos, an "AI for Ecology Toolbox", and several collaborative publications to support ecologists in using artificial intelligence.
