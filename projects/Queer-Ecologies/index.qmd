[Aspen Ellis](www.boriellis.github.io) and I first designed and taught our course, titled [**Queer Ecologies**](www.allisonpayne.github.io/queerecologies), in spring 2023. This class was a seminar style undergraduate course designed to expand students' horizons, incorporate diverse perspectives into the existing curriculum, and build community. We're thrilled to be offering the class again in spring 2024.

Don't miss checking out our students' incredible Unessay[^1] projects [here](https://allisonpayne.github.io/queerecologies/2023/week10.html)!
