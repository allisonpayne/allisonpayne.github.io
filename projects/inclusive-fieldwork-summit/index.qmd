I received a Beyond Compliance grant from UC Santa Cruz to host a small group of UC faculty, postdocs, and grad students who do ecological field research for one weekend at Blue Oak Ranch Reserve. Our goals were to build community, share resources, and identify pressing needs.

The Summit was held in June 2024 (check out the website [here](https://jasper-cat-921.notion.site/43bde69971c8403d91cb2f9a4fb18e75?v=16b6c3408d514d34ada36ebf36d1db99)). As an output from the Summit, we created an assessment tool to support labs, field courses, and field stations in creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ researchers.
