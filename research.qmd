I am interested in optimizing ecological research for scientific impact, education, and inclusion by championing on the benefits of long-term ecological studies, open science, and inclusive research practices.

## Long term studies

Long-term studies can help answer pressing ecological questions while simultaneously creating research opportunties for early-career ecologists. I have enjoyed teaching and mentoring undergraduates as a field leader at AÃ±o Nuevo State Park for the Beltran lab's research assistant program. I have also been a teaching assistant for an upper division field class, *Field Methods for Large Marine Vertebrates,* in which I help guide undergraduates through the scientific process from formulating questions, to collecting data, to publishing the results. We currently have published two manuscripts from these classes, including my dissertation chapter on reproductive senescence in elephant seals.

**Selected projects:**

[*Elephant seal reproductive senescence*](https://allisonpayne.github.io/sealaging/paperv3.html)

[*Seals as sentinels*](https://allisonpayne.github.io/projects/seals-as-sentinels/)

[*Long-term studies for inclusive education*](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14482)

## Open science

In addition to ecological questions, I am also interested in the process of scientific discovery. Whether it's using science facilitation practices to help research teams create new knowledge, documenting the use of open science tools, or distilling best practices from an ecological sub-field, I want to know more about the people, practices, and tools that make science happen.

**Selected projects:**

[*Biologging Instrument Impact Review*](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/6784/)

[*EcoViz + AI Workshop Science Facilitator*](https://harmless-dolomite-426.notion.site/ac0866fc656441d7a26c071ad528ed15?v=8f6278b036774b7b86e969dbc31e3de4)

[*Open Biologging Project*](https://flukeandfeather.github.io/openbiologging/)

## Inclusive research practices

I believe in thinking deeply not only about my research questions, but also how that research is done. I'm passionate about creating more inclusive environments and have worked in particular on several projects to improve the safety of LGBTQ+ scientists.

**Selected projects:**

[*Queer Ecologies*](https://allisonpayne.github.io/queerecologies/)*, an undergraduate course in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology*

[*Queer & Trans Inclusive Field Summit*](https://jasper-cat-921.notion.site/43bde69971c8403d91cb2f9a4fb18e75?v=16b6c3408d514d34ada36ebf36d1db99)*, founder and facilitator*

[*Oceanography's Diversity Deficit*](https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/36-4-payne.pdf)*, co-led with labmates Salma Abdel-Raheem and Milagros Rivera*
