My research themes include the ecology of marine predators, the science of science, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Read about projects related to these topics below, or browse all projects [here](https://allisonpayne.github.io/projects.html).

## Ecology of marine predators

I'm interested in using a variety of complementary tools to answer questions about remote ocean ecosystems. As a PhD student in the Beltran Lab, I assist with the elephant seal monitoring program at AÃ±o Nuevo State Park. This rich long-term dataset has provided opportunities to take on projects spanning ecology, demography, and biologging. I have also enjoyed teaching and mentoring undergraduates as a field leader for the Beltran lab's research assistant program and as a teaching assistant for an upper division field class, *Field Methods for Large Marine Vertebrates,* in which I help guide undergraduates through the scientific process from formulating questions, to collecting data, to publishing the results.

## Science of science

In addition to ecological questions, I am also interested in the process of scientific discovery. Whether it's using science facilitation practices to help research teams create new knowledge, documenting the use of open science tools, or distilling best practices from an ecological sub-field, I want to know more about the people, practices, and tools that make science happen.
