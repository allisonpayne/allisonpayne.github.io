[Hi there!]{.custom-subtitle}

I'm a PhD student in the Beltran Lab at UC Santa Cruz interested in utilizing long-term ecological data sets for conservation.

My current projects focus on demography, passive acoustics, and bio-logging. I'm passionate about inclusive teaching, mentoring/publishing with undergraduates, and science facilitation practices.
