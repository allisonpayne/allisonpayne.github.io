I'm a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at UC Santa Cruz. I'm a member of the Beltran Lab, whose members focus on a diversity of projects related to bio-logging, elephant seals, demography, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

My dissertation will focus on:

-   identifying best practices for bio-logging instrumentation across walkers, swimmers, and flyers

-   detecting cryptic beaked whale species in Monterey Bay from fixed hydrophones

-   instrumenting elephant seals with a novel passive acoustic instrument to detect beaked whales across the North Pacific
